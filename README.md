# Core
My core C# libraries. Contains:
- `StateMachine`: A simple state machine implementation. 
Allows you to define states and transitions between them. Each state can have an entry and exit action.
- `Logger`: A simple logging interface, 
with a default implementation that logs to the console with simple formatting.
